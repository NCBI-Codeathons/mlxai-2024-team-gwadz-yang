Given that you have around 14,947 unique curated names to predict, you will need to convert these text outputs into numerical values that can be processed by machine learning algorithms. Here are some methods you can use:

### Text Vectorization Techniques

1. **Label Encoding**: Assign a unique integer to each unique curated name. This is a simple approach but does not capture any semantic information about the names.
2. **One-Hot Encoding**: Create a binary vector for each curated name with a 1 in the position corresponding to the index of the name and 0s elsewhere. This method can lead to very high-dimensional data and does not capture semantic information.
3.  **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Convert the text to word frequency vectors that reflect how important a word is to a document in a collection of documents. This method is better for information retrieval and keyword extraction but does not capture the semantic meaning of words.
4. **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)**: Use pre-trained word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe to convert words into vectors that capture semantic meaning. These embeddings represent words in a continuous vector space where semantically similar words are mapped to nearby points.
5. **Custom Embeddings**: Train your own embeddings on your dataset using neural network architectures like Word2Vec or GloVe if you have enough data and computational resources.


### Implementation Steps

1. **Choose a Vectorization Technique**: Based on the nature of your curated names and the requirements of your machine learning model, select an appropriate text vectorization technique.
2. **Preprocess Text**: Clean and preprocess your text data by tokenizing the curated names and possibly removing stop words or applying stemming/lemmatization if necessary.
3. **Convert Text to Vectors**: Apply the chosen vectorization technique to transform the curated names into numerical vectors.
4. **Prepare the Dataset**: Combine the numerical vectors with the rest of your dataset, ensuring that each input (architecture and superfamily strings) is associated with the correct output vector (curated name).
5. **Train/Test Split**: Split your dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of your machine learning model.
6. **Model Training**: Use the training data to train your machine learning model to predict the numerical vectors corresponding to the curated names.
7. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using appropriate metrics, and adjust your approach as needed.


Given the number of unique curated names, using word embeddings or training custom embeddings might be the most effective approach, as they can capture the semantic relationships between different names, which could be beneficial for the prediction task. However, if you are looking for a simpler approach and computational resources are a concern, label encoding or one-hot encoding could be used as a starting point.
