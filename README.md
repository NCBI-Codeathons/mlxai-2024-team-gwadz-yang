## Project Goals

## Approach
SPARCLE, the Subfamily Protein Architecture Labeling Engine, is a resource for the functional characterization and labeling of protein sequences that have been grouped by their characteristic conserved domain architecture. A domain architecture is defined as the sequential order of conserved domains in a protein sequence.  see: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/sparcle/docs/sparcle_about.html

Primarily, names and functional annotations are added through manual curation. However, it would be preferable if automated processes could support and supplement curation efforts. Currently, there are over 42k curated architectures out of over 220k in the SPARCLE database.  Automated processes to name could be based on using previously curated architectures to name related architectures. (Because the CDD imports domain models from multiple resources, there can be numerous CDs that model overlapping protein footprints (clusters of these models are called 'superfamilies'). Therefore, numerous architectures could be given the same name ) Another approach could be to use name and labels attached to CDs and superfamilies within an architecture to predict a useful name for the architecture.
